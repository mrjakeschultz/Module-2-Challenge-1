    Was unsure how to handle the div below with the 'hero' class accordingly.
    You can background the image that way. But where does the alt go? 
    Added a title attribute to do the same thing. -->

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            conference table, with speech bubbles saying: 'like'; 'media'; and 'share'. On the table are several large stickers depicting icons from
            popular social media platforms and the word 'tweet'."/>
            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

            <p>

            should be there is an icon of of a lightbulb surrounded by squiggles representing outward electromagnetic radiation broadcast."/>

                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
